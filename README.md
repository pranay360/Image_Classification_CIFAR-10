## Image Classification on CIFAR-10 Dataset using Multi-Layer Perceptrons in Python from scratch.

- ### CIFAR10 Dataset can be found here - [click Here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- ### Download the Python Batches Dataset and put it in %pwd/cifar-10-batches-py/  

+ Implemented a N layer _Deep Neural Network with Backpropagation for CIFAR-10 __Image Classification__  _from scratch in Python, to get the basic understanding of the backpropagation and gradient descent algorithm. 


- __Warning:__ Due to lack of GPU support and no. of layers being > 1 the model trains very slow.
